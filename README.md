# Fetch-Take-Home-Exercise

Hi! This repository contains all my code for the tasks. `fetch.ipynb` contains the code for Task 1 and Task 4. All written answers can be found there too. In case there are any issues with running the notebook, the tasks folder contains the scripts for 1 and 4. `sentence_transformer.py` contains all the classes that I used including the code for Task 1 and Task 2. 

Thank you for the opportunity. Excited to hear back soon!
